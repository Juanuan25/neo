                Dawarich is a self-hosted location history (Google Timeline alternative): a map of where you have been, trips, visits, and stats.
                Neo runs the upstream Docker stack: the Rails app, a Sidekiq worker, PostGIS for the points, and Redis for jobs and live updates, on the internal network behind SWAG and tinyauth.
                Phone apps and trackers (OwnTracks, Overland, Traccar, the Dawarich apps) post to /api/ with a Dawarich API key, so that path bypasses tinyauth. The web UI stays behind tinyauth, then Dawarich's own login.
                The image tag is pinned. Dawarich asks you to read the release notes before upgrading. Change the app and Sidekiq image together.
                The first boot creates an admin user demo@dawarich.app with password safepassword. Change that password after you sign in.
